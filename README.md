Extensions to the ZK Tookit - see zkoss.org

This repository contains extensions to the ZK Toolkit that make it, in my opinion, easier to use.
For example the first extension we are adding here is a component to build a Tabbed Pane. In ZK 
a Tabbed Pane must be assembled from a Tabbox by adding pairs of Tabpanels and Tabs.  I found this
to be inconvenient so I created BTabbedPane. 

Enjoy.
